# uitb-tools

This python package provides tools to analyze data from biomechanical movement simulations related to the [User-in-the-Box (uitb)](https://github.com/aikkala/user-in-the-box) framework.

The following tools are currently available:
- `uitb_evaluate`, a plotting and evaluation tool, including methods to plot end-effector trajectories, joint trajectories, and summary statistics such as movement duration (Fitts' Law), and methods to compute and visualize quantitative measurements such as RMSE between simulation data and user data *(still WIP)*.

### Installation:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
